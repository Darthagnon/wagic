#Commander 2015 addon for Wagic the Homebrew
#Coded by the Wagic Community
#
#Missing Cards
#---------------
# Command Beacon - There is no Command Zone in Wagic. An overpowered work around would be Sacrifice this and put legendary creature into play from your hand.
# 5 Confluence cards - multiple choices - not exactly sure how to code.
# Dream Pillager - not sure about how to code the cast cards from exile effect.
# Ezuri's Predation - Possible as a work around but I am not exactly sure how to force multiple token creatures to fight different separate target creatures.
# Gigantoplasm - not sure how to code.
# Mizzix of the Izmagnus - Affiity for Experience counters casting cost reduction effect - not sure how to code.
# Myriad Cards - in a two player game they are not supposed to generate a clone token. Taking this ability out nerfs them.
# Sandstone Oracle - player has more cards in hand than you, draw cards equal to the difference - not sure how to code.
# Tablet of the Guilds - not sure how to code.
